GPT-4o mini
GPT-4o mini (“o” for “omni”) is our most advanced model in the small models category, and our cheapest model yet. It is multimodal (accepting text or image inputs and outputting text), has higher intelligence than gpt-3.5-turbo but is just as fast. It is meant to be used for smaller tasks, including vision tasks.

We recommend choosing gpt-4o-mini where you would have previously used gpt-3.5-turbo as this model is more capable and cheaper.
